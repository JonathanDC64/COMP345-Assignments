{{Plot}} The show opens with Fred Graham and Lilli Vanessi , a divorced couple, meeting at Fred's apartment to hear the score for the Cole Porter musical version of "The Taming of the Shrew". Lois Lane , who is to play Bianca, arrives and sings "Too Darn Hot". Lilli almost decides against performing in the show, as she fears it might interfere with her honeymoon. But when she overhears Cole and Fred promising Lois the part, she decides to play Katherine after all. Lois' boyfriend, Bill Calhoun , is playing Lucentio in the musical but in between rehearsals, he leads a gambling lifestyle, which results in him owing a local gangster $2,000, but he has signed the IOU in Fred's name. Lois laments Bill's bad-boy lifestyle , but Bill's winsome charm soon wins her over, and she forgives him. Meanwhile, after a fiery confrontation during rehearsals, Fred and Lilli get together in Lilli's dressing room, and reminisce about happier times, singing "Wunderbar" from a show they did together. Fred later sends flowers to Lois but his butler gets confused and gives them to Lilli instead. Lilli is overcome by this romantic gesture and falls back in love with Fred, ("So In Love . The show gets underway, with Fred, Lilli, Lois and Bill dressed as a group of traveling entertainers, . The main body of the play is their enactment of Shakespeare's, "The Taming of The Shrew"- the script is largely the same as Shakespeare's, but interspersed with Cole Porter's songs. In the play, Bianca, the younger daughter of Baptista, a Paduan merchant, wishes to marry, but her father will not allow it until his elder daughter, Katherine, is married. Bianca has three suitors – Gremio, Hortensio and Lucentio – and each of them try to persuade her to choose him as her husband. She is prepared to marry anyone, . Lucentio's friend Petruchio arrives in Padua, seeking a wife, , and when he hears of Katherine, he resolves to woo her. Katherine, however, hates the idea of getting married, . Petruchio serenades Katherine . Lilli is so moved by Fred's heartfelt delivery of the song, that she can't resist reading the card that came with the flowers, having placed it next to her heart. She sees that it is addressed to Lois, and attacks Fred mercilessly on stage, ad-libbing verbal abuse. As the curtain comes down, Fred has had enough, and spanks Lilli. Lilli resolves to leave the theatre with her fiancé, Tex Calloway ; she phones him and tells him to pick her up, preferably with an ambulance. Meanwhile, Lippy and Slug, a pair of gang enforcers, arrive to collect Bill's IOU from Fred. Fred decides to accept the IOU and convinces Lippy and Slug that he needs them to help keep Lilli from leaving so that the show will be successful enough for Fred to afford the debt. Lois, in the meantime, learns that Fred has taken responsibility for the IOU and she comes to thank him, but each time she begins to thank him for not being angry about Bill forging his name, Fred kisses her passionately to prevent Lippy and Slug from learning about his deception. Lilli and Bill both walk in on this little scene and become furious. In order to keep Lilli from leaving the show, Slug and Lippy appear on stage, disguised as Petruchio's servants, keeping an eye on Lilli. They have no acting ability, but still manage to amuse the audience. There is much less singing from this point onwards in the musical. In the play, Petruchio sets about "taming the shrew", by refusing to let Katherine eat, or sleep in a comfortable bed. Petruchio, however, is unhappy with his new married life, and reminisces about his days of philandering, and his many previous girlfriends, . At Lilli's request via the phone earlier in the evening, Tex arrives with an ambulance, and Lilli finally escapes her tormentors and the pair prepare to leave. But Fred befriends Tex in the hopes of delaying their departure. Tex is recognized by Lois, with whom he once went on a date. Although Tex claims she has mistaken him for someone else, Bill is angered by Lois' behavior. Lois admits that though she loves Bill, she cannot resist the advances of other men . It turns out her morals are even looser than Bill's. Fred's gambling debt is resolved by the untimely death of Mr. Hogan, Slug and Lippy's boss. Lilli succeeds in leaving the theatre, saying a surprisingly civil farewell to Fred. Fred thinks that she belongs in the theatre, and tries in vain to stop her from leaving. After her departure, Fred is dejected, but Slug and Lippy manage to cheer him up, . The last part of the play begins with Bianca finally getting married to Lucentio. Gremio and Hortensio are put out, but two other girls appear and each of the three couples has their own dance sequence in the next song, . At the finale, the show is halted when Lilli's understudy, Jeanie, who is mentioned several times in the musical but never appears, goes missing. Suddenly, Lilli appears on stage and recites Katherine's speech about how women should surrender to their husbands, . Fred is bowled over, and the show reaches its triumphant finale giving the impression that Fred and Lilli will once again get together permanently.

In 1922, Scott Mason Carter graduates from Chase Medical School in Chicago. Immediately afterward, Scott and Marcia , both light-skinned enough to look white, are married. Scott has landed an internship, but his fellow graduate, the dark-skinned Jesse Pridham ([[Ray Saunders , wonders if he will have to work as a Pullman porter until there is an opening in a black hospital. In Georgia, the black hospital director tells Scott that the board of directors has decided to give preference to "Southern" applicants, and rescinds the job offer. Marcia insists her husband continue searching for another medical job. In the meantime, they live in Boston with Marcia's parents, who have successfully passed for white. Her father and some of their black friends suggest they do the same. Instead, Scott continues to openly apply as a Negro, only to be rejected time and time again. Scott finally gives in, quits his job making shoes, and masquerades as white for a one-year internship in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. While there, Scott responds to an emergency. At an isolated lighthouse, he has to operate immediately on a sport fisherman who is bleeding to death from a penetrating duodenal ulcer. His patient turns out to be Dr. Walter Bracket , a well-known director of a clinic. Impressed, the recovering Dr. Bracket offers him the position of town doctor in Keenham, New Hampshire, replacing Bracket's father, who recently died after 50 years of service. Scott turns down the offer, explaining that he is a Negro. Dr. Bracket, though he admits he would not have made the offer had he known, recommends Scott take the job without revealing his race. With a baby on the way, Scott reluctantly agrees. The child's birth is cause for much worry. To everyone's relief, the boy looks white. When the local rector and his wife welcome the new residents, Marcia tells them her boy will be named after Scott's mentor, Dr. Charles Howard. The rector tells Marcia he met a doctor by that name. However, he assumes it must not be the same one, since that Dr. Howard was black. Scott slowly earns the trust and respect of the residents. By 1942, when the United States enters World War II, the Carters are pillars of the community. Their son, Howard, attends the University of New Hampshire, while daughter Shelly is in high school. The Carters have managed to keep their secret, even from their own children. Scott goes to Boston once a week to work at the Charles Howard Clinic, which he and Jesse Pridham established for patients of all races. Howard invites Arthur Cooper , a black classmate, to Keenham. Shelly worries what her friends will think about a "coon" staying in their home. Scott sternly orders her never to use that word again. When Arthur goes to a party with Howard, a few guests make bigoted remarks behind his back. Howard and Scott both enlist in the Navy. However, Scott's commission as a lieutenant commander is suddenly revoked for "failure to meet physical conditions" after his background is investigated; the only position in the Navy for blacks is as a steward. The Carters have no choice but to finally reveal their secret to their children. Howard breaks up with his white girlfriend and disappears. He roams the streets of Harlem and rents a room there. When Shelly's boyfriend Andy asks her what she is going to do about the "awful rumor" circulating about her family, Shelly confesses that it is true. Her boyfriend asks her to the school dance anyway, but she turns him down. Howard investigates screams coming from a tenement building and finds two black men fighting. When one is knocked down, and the other pulls out a gun, Howard intervenes, and the gun goes off. The gunman flees, but Howard is taken into custody. To a sympathetic black police lieutenant , Howard explains, "I came here to find out what it's like to be a Negro." Arthur Cooper collects his friend. Howard goes to his father's clinic. Scott tells him, "I brought you up as white. There's no reason why you shouldn't continue to live that way." They return home. When they go to the church service, the minister preaches a sermon of tolerance, then notes that the Navy has just ended its racist policy. The narrator notes that Scott Carter remains the doctor for a small New Hampshire town.

Title: dennis the menace
Release date: 1993-06-24

Dennis Mitchell is a five-year-old boy who lives with his parents Henry and Alice, and is the bane of next door neighbor George Wilson's existence. Because of his trouble-making but unintentional behavior, his parents often struggle to find suitable babysitters to deal with him. On one night, they manage to get one named Polly and her boyfriend Mickey to babysit him, but repeated doorbell pranks from him push the two too far , and they end up pulling a prank on George when he rings the doorbell to scold Dennis after finding paint and wood in his food in an earlier incident. While all of this and the rest of the events in town go on, a burglar named Switchblade Sam arrives in town and begins robbing houses, as well as striking fear into the children that he meets. Dennis' parents are both called away on business trips at the same time, and when everyone they know refuses to look after him, they turn to George and his wife Martha to look after him. George is further irritated by him spilling bath water on the bathroom floor, swapping chemicals, and bringing his pet dog, Ruff, into the house for a while. All of this is happening around the time the Summer Floraganza, a long-awaited event, is scheduled to happen. As a longtime member of the local garden club, George is chosen to host it. He is excited to have this honor, as he has been growing and nurturing a rare plant for forty years. After growing for the said length of time, its flower finally blooms, only to die several seconds later. Alice gets stuck at the airport due to a storm, thus forcing Dennis to stay with the Wilsons for an extra night, which coincides with the unveiling of the plant and its blooming to the members of the garden club. While that is happening, he is sent away for causing trouble , when he hears Switchblade Sam robbing the house. He goes downstairs, and finds George's gold coins missing. He runs outside to tell him just as the flower is beginning to bloom, which causes him and all the guests to miss its entire lifespan. Not knowing about the robbery, he severely scolds him, tells him that he has no use for him, and that he doesn't want to know or see him anymore. Shortly thereafter, Dennis gets on his bicycle and rides off into the night, eventually bumping into Switchblade Sam in the woods. Sam then abducts him, intending to use the child as a hostage. Dennis' parents return home and learn of his departure, and they, the authorities, his friends , and George search all night for him. Around the same time, Dennis unintentionally but effectively defeats Switchblade Sam by tying him up and handcuffing him, losing the key, and repeatedly setting him on fire, amongst other things. He returns to George's house the next morning with Switchblade Sam in his wagon, having also recovered George's gold coins, and Sam is taken into police custody by a slightly amused sheriff who had previously advised him to leave town. Dennis and George make up, and the Mitchells and Wilsons become friends on better terms. That night, George explains that he's learned some things about kids: kids are kids, and that one has to play by their rules, roll with the punches, and expect the unexpected. The film's end credits are accompanied with Dennis inadvertently humiliating his mother's egotistical coworker, Andrea, while she is using a photocopier. Dennis impishly whacks the "PRINT" button and runs away, with other workers looking on. Andrea loses her balance and her head gets pinned face-down on the scanner-bed, and the machine relentlessly flashes its blinding light in her eyes as it repeatedly "takes her picture" and spews out page after page of black-and-white "photos" showing her various agonized facial expressions as she writhes about on the scanner bed.
